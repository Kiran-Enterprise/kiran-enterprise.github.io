          <p>
            When someone sells us a laptop, they usually mention the desktop in the storeroom, the
            monitor that stopped working two years ago, and the box of chargers nobody can throw
            away. None of it had anywhere responsible to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we started collecting it, and then buying the parts too: RAM, drives, mini PCs,
            workstations and servers, from individuals, offices and dealers alike. Working hardware
            gets a second life through our buyback side. Everything else is sorted and handed to
            authorised recyclers who recover the metals and handle the rest safely. Offices get the
            paperwork they need to close out their asset registers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today we run both sides from {site.contact.city}, with free pickup across the city and
            walk-ins welcome during working hours.
